SYNOPSIS
      use Archive::Tar::Streamed;

      my $fh;
      open $fh,'>','/home/myarch.tar' or die "Couldn't create archive";
      binmode $fh;
      my $tar = Archive::Tar::Streamed->new($fh);
      $tar->add('file1');
      $tar->add(@files);

      my $fh2l
      open $fh2,'<','prevarch.tar' or die "Couldn't open archive";
      binmode $fh;
      my $tar2 = Archive::Tar::Streamed->new($fh2);
      my $fil = $tar2->next;

DESCRIPTION
    The Archive::Tar module is a powerfull tool for manipulating archives
    from perl. However, most of the time, this module needs the entire
    archive to be resident in memory. This renders the module per se, not to
    be directly usable for very large archive (of the order of gigabytes).

    Archive::Tar::Streamed provides a wrapper, which allows working with tar
    archives on disk, with no need for the archive to be memory resident.

    This module provides an alternative answer to the FAQ "Isn't
    Archive::Tar heavier on memory than /bin/tar?". It also aims to be
    portable, and available on platforms without a native tar.

  add
    This is a method call to add one or more files to an archive. These are
    written to disk before the method returns.

  next
    This method is an iterator, which returns an Archive::Tar::File object
    for the next file, or undef. undef indicates the end of the archive; any
    unexpected conditions result in throwing an exception.

INSTALLATION
    Please follow the usual steps for installing a Perl module:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

    substitute any platform specific make, e.g. use nmake on Windows.

    Makefile.PL prompts for a tar program. This is only needed in order
    to run the full suite of tests.
